/**
 * Framework-free per-member projection store.
 *
 * Holds the latest projected value per (slug, key), fed by two WebSocket
 * frames and a roster baseline. Three invariants keep it correct against
 * replays, races, and server restarts:
 *
 *   - higher-seq-wins: apply() drops any frame whose seq <= the held row's
 *     seq, so replays and out-of-order stale frames are no-ops.
 *   - seed never truncates: the roster baseline only ever applies values; a
 *     live frame that raced ahead of the baseline keeps winning.
 *   - truncate only from the subscribed frame: rows with seq > lastSeq are
 *     dropped ONLY when the server tells us (members_subscribed), which is the
 *     one moment we learn a torn tail was rolled back after a restart.
 *
 * faceOf() exposes a useSyncExternalStore-shaped view per (slug, key) whose
 * snapshot is referentially stable until that row actually changes.
