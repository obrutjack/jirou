"""Best-effort hook helpers for the per-member append-only event log.

Every function here is additive and swallows its own failures: a logging fault
must never break the path it is hooked into. The event-log service itself
(``kiro_crew.eventlog.service``) is filled in concurrently and its bodies may
still raise ``NotImplementedError`` while callers run, which is precisely why
:func:`emit` wraps ensure+append in a blanket ``try/except``.

The service contract this codes against is synchronous:

    svc = get_service()
    svc.ensure(slug, name)
    svc.append(slug, type, data)
    svc.attach_broadcast(fn)

Imports of the service and of the members module are done lazily inside the
functions to avoid import cycles with ``dashboard.state`` and
``slack.gateway``.
