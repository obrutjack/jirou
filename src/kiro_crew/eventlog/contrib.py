"""Contribution protocol: the gateway side of an out-of-process contributor.

Implements ``docs/system-specs/modules/contribution-protocol.md``. Three pieces
live here, and the HTTP handlers, the WebSocket hub and app teardown are thin
callers of them:

``UnitRegistry``
    Which unit kinds have a log. A kind is a REGISTRATION -- ``{kind, id_field,
    frame, service}`` -- so adding a second kind is one ``register_unit`` call
    rather than a rewrite of the routes. Today: ``member``.

``ExternalProjectionStore``
    One row per ``(kind, id, key)`` published from outside, with higher-seq-wins
    and a ``stateVersion`` override, plus an optional render schema per key.
    Durable, because a contributor publishes at its own cadence: an in-memory
    table would drop every contributed card on a gateway restart and leave the
    Members page blank until the contributor happened to re-fold.

``EventBudget``
    Per app, per unit, per UTC day. Deliberately process memory: the budget
    bounds one gateway's exposure to a runaway contributor, and a restart is
    already the loudest possible signal that the process is not the one that
    counted. Persisting it would buy a stricter bound on a resource (log bytes)
    that the 64 KiB per-event cap already bounds.

Nothing here executes contributor code. A contributor reads events, folds in its
own process, and publishes whole values; the gateway stays the only writer of
every log.
