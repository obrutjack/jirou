"""MemberEventLogService — the one door to per-member append-only logs.

Contract (implemented in this module; callers import only from here):

    svc = get_service()                       # lazy singleton rooted at the member crew log root
    svc.attach_broadcast(state.broadcast_ws)  # once, at dashboard startup
    svc.ensure(slug, name)                    # create the log + header if missing (migrates legacy files)
    ev = svc.append(slug, type, data)         # write + fsync, fold projections, push member_projection frames
    svc.snapshot(slug)                        # {"asOfSeq": int, "values": {key: view}}
    svc.history(slug, before=None, limit=50)  # newest-first page of envelopes
    svc.last_seq(slug)                        # -1 for an empty log
    svc.last_seqs()                           # {slug: last_seq} for every known log
    svc.slugs()                               # every member with a log on disk

All methods are synchronous. A write is one line appended under a per-slug
lock and fsync'd before it returns; projections fold in the same call and the
broadcast is only enqueued. Callers on the event loop pay one fsync per
append, which is the pilot's accepted cost.
