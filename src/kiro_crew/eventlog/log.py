"""One member's append-only log, stored as a ``member``-kind crew log.

This module is an ADAPTER, not a log implementation. The bytes, the locking, the
durability and the repair all belong to :mod:`kiro_crew.crew_log.store`, which
already owns them for the ``crew`` and ``session`` kinds::

    <data home>/crew-log/members/<store name>/log.jsonl

A member's log is a third KIND there rather than a second mechanism beside it.
That is the whole point of this file being thin: the ``crew-log`` root is masked
from the sandbox and fenced against the agent file tools (``security/paths.py``,
``sandbox.py``), named at the root so every kind inherits it. A per-member log
stored anywhere else would need its own fence entry, and the next log added would
miss it the same way -- an append-only record the agent can rewrite is not an
append-only record, and that property has to hold by WHERE THE FILE LIVES rather
than by someone remembering to list it.

Two translations live here and nowhere else, so nothing above this layer changes:

**Sequence numbers.** A crew log numbers the header 0 and the first entry 1. This
surface has always numbered the first event 0, and its ``seq`` travels to the
browser in ``member_projection`` frames and back in catch-up reads, so the
translation is applied at the boundary (``entry.seq - 1``) rather than renumbering
a protocol that clients already speak.

**Contributed event types.** A crew log keeps exactly one guest TYPE namespace,
``app:<name>/<action>``, and grants it to the ``member`` kind. The contribution
protocol spells the same thing ``<app>/<action>``. The stored form takes the
``app:`` prefix so the log's own ownership rule decides the write, and the read
gives the protocol spelling back, so an app's declared ``contributions.events``
and every frame carrying them are untouched.
