"""Per-connection event-log subscriptions for app-token WebSockets.

The contribution protocol's §3 delta channel. One hub for the whole gateway,
holding a bounded queue and one pump task per SUBSCRIBED SOCKET -- not per
subscription, so a socket watching thirty units still has one writer and one
place where backpressure is decided.

The three properties the contract names, and where each lives:

``eventlog_subscribed`` precedes every ``eventlog_event``
    :meth:`EventLogHub.subscribe` registers the socket for fan-out FIRST, then
    returns the ``lastSeq`` for the caller to send inline, and only then does the
    pump start. Events appended during that window sit in the queue rather than
    being lost, so the common case has no gap at all -- and the frame the client
    reads first is still ``eventlog_subscribed``, because the caller writes it to
    the socket before the pump is allowed to write anything.

The channel is a DELTA channel
    The hub never re-sends and never reorders: a frame it could not enqueue is
    dropped, and the socket is closed rather than left folding across a gap. The
    consumer's ``seq === last + 1`` check plus ``GET .../events?after=`` is the
    recovery path, and closing is what forces it.

A slow subscriber is closed, not buffered
    ``_QUEUE_LIMIT`` frames per socket. Over that, the socket is closed with a
    policy-violation code. Growing the queue instead would let one wedged
    contributor hold the gateway's memory hostage, and the contract explicitly
    reserves the right to close a slow subscriber.

Appends arrive on whatever thread wrote the log (the members handler offloads to
a worker), so :meth:`publish` is thread-safe and hops to the serving loop.
